2. A brief introduction explaining the document's purpose
3. A table of contents for documents longer than a few paragraphs
4. Properly nested headings (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
5. Code examples where appropriate
6. Cross-references to related documents
7. Implementation status indicators where appropriate

### Style Guide

1. Use American English spelling and grammar
2. Write in a clear, concise style
3. Use active voice where possible
4. Keep paragraphs focused on a single topic
5. Use proper Markdown formatting:
   - `#` for headings (not underlines)

## Building the Documentation

We use `mdbook` to build the documentation. To get started:

1. Install required tools:
   ```bash
   make install-tools
   ```

2. Build the documentation:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. View the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Documentation Maintenance

Use the following make commands for documentation maintenance:

- `make lint` - Check for style issues
- `make toc` - Generate table of contents
- `make check` - Check for broken links
- `make validate` - Validate documentation structure
- `make update-dates` - Update last modified dates
