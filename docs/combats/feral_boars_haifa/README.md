# Combat Encounter: The Haifa Hog Hustle

## Overview

This document outlines a combat encounter scenario set in Haifa, Israel, where the player(s) are unexpectedly confronted by a massive horde of feral boars intent on stealing their food.

**Location:** Urban or park setting within Haifa, Israel.
**Time:** Daytime, potentially during a meal break for the player(s).
**Antagonists:** 500 Feral Boars.
**Motivation:** Extreme hunger, driving them to aggressively pursue any available food source, specifically targeting the player(s)' provisions.

## Setup

*   The player(s) are assumed to be resting or eating in an open area (e.g., a park, a beachfront, an outdoor cafe seating area).
*   Place food items conspicuously near the player(s).
*   The boars emerge suddenly from surrounding areas (alleyways, dense shrubbery, nearby streets), converging on the players' location.
*   Due to the sheer number, the boars effectively surround the players quickly.

## The Boars

*   **Quantity:** 500. While numerous, they might not all engage simultaneously. Consider waves or thematic groups based on the encounter area size. They might clog pathways and create environmental obstacles.
*   **Stats:** Use standard "Feral Boar" stats appropriate for the game system. Their primary strength is overwhelming numbers and single-minded focus on food. They are not particularly cunning but are highly aggressive when food is involved.
    *   *Optional Rule:* Implement swarm mechanics if the system supports it.
*   **Tactics:**
    *   **Charge:** Boars will charge directly towards any visible food or player carrying food.
    *   **Overwhelm:** They will use their numbers to surround and impede player movement.
    *   **Disruption:** Non-engaged boars might knock over tables, scatter belongings, or create general chaos.
    *   **Morale:** Individual boars might flee if significantly injured, but the presence of the horde and the scent of food keeps them largely committed. A significant reduction in numbers (e.g., below 50%) or the loss of the food stimulus might trigger a mass retreat.

## Player Objectives

1.  **Survive:** Avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer number of boars.
2.  **Protect the Food:** Prevent the boars from consuming or carrying off their provisions.
3.  **Drive Off/Escape:** Disperse the horde or find a way to safely exit the encounter area.

## Resolution

*   **Success:** Players manage to protect their food and either drive off the boars (perhaps by eliminating a certain number, scaring them with loud noises/fire, or cleverly hiding/securing the food) or escape the area. Reward: Keeping their lunch, perhaps some minor XP for handling a chaotic situation creatively.
*   **Partial Success:** Players survive but lose some or all of their food.
*   **Failure:** Players are overwhelmed (potentially non-lethally, just roughed up and food stolen) or forced to abandon their meal entirely to escape.

## Potential Mechanics & Considerations

*   **Environment:** Utilize environmental objects. Can players climb onto structures? Are there narrow passages to funnel the boars? Can barriers be created?
*   **Food as Bait:** Can players use food to lure boars into traps or away from their main position?
*   **Non-Lethal Options:** Emphasize that these are hungry animals, not inherently evil monsters. Provide options for scaring them away rather than just wholesale slaughter.
*   **Performance:** Simulating 500 individual entities might be demanding. Consider abstracting the horde into larger "swarm" units or focusing on the boars immediately engaging the players.
