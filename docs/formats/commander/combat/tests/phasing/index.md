# Combat Phasing Tests

This section contains tests for phasing effects during combat in the Commander format.

## Tests

### [Phasing During Combat](phasing_during_combat.md)

Tests for how phasing effects interact with various stages of combat, including:
- Attackers phasing out after being declared
- Blockers phasing out after being declared
- Permanents with combat-relevant abilities phasing out
- Phasing effects on auras and equipment attached to creatures in combat
- Phasing and combat damage
- Phasing interaction with combat triggers

These tests ensure that the complex rules interactions between phasing and combat are handled correctly within the game engine.
