# Combat Pump Spell Tests

This section contains tests for power and toughness modifying effects (pump spells) during combat in the Commander format.

## Tests

### [Combat Pumps](combat_pumps.md)

Tests for how pump spells and similar effects interact with combat, including:
- Instant-speed pump spells after blockers are declared
- Pump effects that grant additional abilities (like first strike)
- Timing of pump effects and their impact on combat damage
- Interaction between multiple pump effects
- Pump effects that last until end of turn versus those with permanent effects
- Combat tricks that affect multiple creatures simultaneously

These tests ensure that power/toughness modification during combat is handled correctly according to the rules and timing of Magic: The Gathering.
