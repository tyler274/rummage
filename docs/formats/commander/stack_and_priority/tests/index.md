# Stack and Priority Tests

This section contains tests related to the stack and priority system in the Commander format.

## Stack Resolution Tests

The [Stack Resolution Tests](stack_resolution.md) validate the proper functioning of the stack in various scenarios, including:

- Proper ordering of spells and abilities on the stack
- Resolution of the stack in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order
- Handling of counterspells and other stack-modifying effects
- Split second and other special timing rules
- Multiplayer priority passing
- Stack interactions with state-based actions

These tests ensure that the stack and priority system conform to Magic: The Gathering rules and behave correctly within the multiplayer context of the Commander format.
