# Zone Tests

This section contains tests related to the various zone mechanics in the Commander format.

## Command Zone Tests

The [Command Zone Tests](command_zone.md) verify the proper behavior of the Command Zone and related mechanics, such as:

- Commander movement to and from the command zone
- Commander tax calculation
- Proper tracking of command zone events
- Integration with state-based actions

These tests ensure that the unique Commander zone mechanics function correctly within the game engine.
