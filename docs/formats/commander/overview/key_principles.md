# Key Principles of Commander

The Commander format is built upon core design principles that guide both the rules and the social contract of the format. These principles inform our implementation in Rummage.

## Social Focus

Commander was designed as a multiplayer, social format where:

1. Fun and memorable gameplay takes precedence over competitive optimization
2. Politics and table talk are encouraged
3. The journey of the game is as important as the outcome
4. Players are encouraged to build decks that express their identity and creativity

## Format Pillars

### Variance and Uniqueness

The singleton requirement (only one copy of each card except basic lands) ensures:

- Every game plays differently
- Decks feel unique and personalized
- Players must be adaptable to changing game states
- Card evaluation differs from other formats

### Commander Identity

The commander serves as:

- The centerpiece of the deck's strategy
- A constant presence throughout the game
- A representation of the player's identity
- A build-around card that shapes deckbuilding decisions

### Multiplayer Dynamics

Commander embraces multiplayer game design through:

- Balanced starting life totals (40 life)
- Political elements like deal-making and temporary alliances
- Mechanics that encourage table-wide interactions
- Rules that prevent early eliminations when possible

## Design Philosophy

The Commander Rules Committee articulates the following design philosophy:

> Commander is designed to promote social games of magic. It suits players who want to:
>
> - Cultivate a casual atmosphere where everyone can have fun, not just the winner
> - Build personalized decks that showcase interesting cards and strategies
> - Create game states full of twists and turns that lead to epic plays and memorable moments

## Implementation in Rummage

Our implementation of Commander in Rummage emphasizes:

1. **Faithful Rules Implementation**: Accurate implementation of the official rules
2. **Social Features**: Support for politics, deals, and multiplayer interactions
3. **Player Expression**: Flexible deck building and commander options
4. **Game Variance**: Random elements and complexity that lead to unique game states
5. **Accessibility**: Clear visualizations of complex board states and commander-specific rules

## Rules vs. Social Contract

We recognize that Commander has both written rules and an unwritten social contract. While we can fully implement the rules, the social contract is up to players. We provide:

- Tools for communication between players
- Flexibility in game settings
- Support for house rules when possible
- Documentation that explains both rules and social expectations
