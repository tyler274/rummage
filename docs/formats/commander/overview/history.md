# Commander Format History

Commander (formerly known as Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) has an interesting history that evolved from a casual player-created format to one of Magic: The Gathering's most popular formats today.

## Origins

The Commander format was created in the late 1990s by judges in Alaska who were looking for a new way to play between tournament rounds. The format was originally called "Elder Dragon Highlander" (EDH) because:

- Players were required to use one of the five Elder Dragons from Legends as their general (later called commander)
- The "Highlander" part referenced the 1986 film and its tagline "There can be only one," signifying the singleton nature of the format

## Evolution of the Format

## Rules Committee

The Commander format is officially governed by the Commander Rules Committee (RC), an independent group that:

- Maintains the format's rules and banned list
- Makes decisions about format changes
- Promotes the philosophy of Commander as a social, multiplayer format

The Rules Committee maintains that Commander should remain primarily a social format that emphasizes fun, memorable gameplay over competition.
