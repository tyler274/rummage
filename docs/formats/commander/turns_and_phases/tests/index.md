# Turn and Phase Tests

This section contains tests related to the turn structure and phase mechanics in the Commander format, with a focus on multiplayer interactions.

## Multiplayer Turn Structure Tests

The [Multiplayer Turn Structure Tests](multiplayer_turn_structure.md) validate the proper handling of turns in a multiplayer environment, including:

- Turn order in multiplayer games
- Turn modification effects (extra turns, skipped turns)
- Phase progression in various game states
- Proper handling of priority in multiplayer scenarios
- Player elimination effects on turn structure

These tests ensure that the multiplayer aspects of the Commander format's turn structure function correctly within the game engine.
