# Commander Format Rules

## Overview

Commander (formerly known as Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a multiplayer variant of Magic: The Gathering with special rules defined in section 903 of the Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules.

## Core Rules

1. **Deck Construction** (rule 903.5)
   - 100-card singleton format (only one copy of each card except for basic lands)
   - Deck can only include cards that match the color identity of the commander
   - Color identity includes all colored mana symbols in the card's cost, rules text, and color indicator

2. **Commander Card** (rule 903.3)
   - Each player designates a legendary creature as their "commander"
   - The commander is placed in the command zone at the start of the game
   - Partner commanders and Background mechanics allow for special exceptions

3. **Life Total** (rule 903.7)
   - Players start with 40 life (instead of the standard 20)

4. **Command Zone Mechanics** (rules 903.8, 903.9)
   - Commanders start in the command zone
   - Commanders can be cast from the command zone for their mana cost, plus an additional {2} for each previous time they've been cast from the command zone ("commander tax")
   - If a commander would be put into a library, hand, graveyard, or exile, its owner may choose to move it to the command zone instead

5. **Commander Damage** (rule 903.10)
   - A player who has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander loses the game

6. **Banned Cards** (rule 903.11)
   - The Commander format has its own banned list maintained by the Commander Rules Committee

## Additional Rules

1. **Multiplayer Rules**
   - Standard multiplayer rules apply (first player doesn't draw, etc.)
   - Free-for-all, attack-anyone format unless playing with teams

2. **Color Identity**
   - A card's color identity includes all mana symbols in its cost and rules text
   - Cards in a player's deck must only contain mana symbols that appear in their commander's color identity
   - Basic land types implicitly have the corresponding mana symbol in their identity

3. **Replacement Commander**
   - In casual play, if a player's commander would be put into a library, hand, graveyard or exile from anywhere, that player may put it into the command zone instead

These rules create a unique gameplay experience that emphasizes multiplayer interaction, powerful cards, and distinctive deck construction constraints.
