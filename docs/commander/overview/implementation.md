# Implementation Approach

## Core Principles

Our implementation of the Commander format follows these key principles:

1. **Rules Accuracy** - Faithfully implement the official Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules for Commander (section 903)
2. **Modularity** - Clear separation of concerns between different aspects of the game engine
3. **Testability** - Comprehensive testing for complex rule interactions
4. **Performance** - Optimized for multiplayer games with up to 13 players
5. **Extensibility** - Easily accommodate new Commander variants and house rules

## Technology Stack

The implementation uses the following technologies:

1. **Bevy ECS** - For game state management and systems organization
2. **Rust** - For type safety and performance
3. **Event-driven architecture** - For game actions and triggers
4. **Automated testing** - For rules validation and edge cases

## Key Implementation Techniques

1. **Component-Based Design**
   ```rust
   // Components for different aspects of game entities
   #[derive(Component)]
   pub struct Commander {
       pub cast_count: u32,
   }
   
   #[derive(Component)]
   pub struct CommanderDamage {
       // Maps commander entity ID to damage received
       pub damage_received: HashMap<Entity, u32>,
   }
   ```

2. **Resource-Based Game State**
   ```rust
   #[derive(Resource)]
   pub struct CommanderGameState {
       pub active_player_index: usize,
       pub player_order: Vec<Entity>,
       pub current_phase: Phase,
       // More fields
   }
   ```

3. **Event-Driven Actions**
   ```rust
   #[derive(Event)]
   pub struct CommanderCastEvent {
       pub commander: Entity,
       pub player: Entity,
       pub from_zone: Zone,
   }
   ```

4. **Systems for Game Logic**
   ```rust
   fn commander_damage_system(
       mut commands: Commands,
       game_state: Res<CommanderGameState>,
       mut damage_events: EventReader<CommanderDamageEvent>,
       mut players: Query<(Entity, &mut CommanderDamage)>,
   ) {
       // Logic implementation
   }
   ```

## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Start with core game state management
   - Layer in Commander-specific rules
   - Add multiplayer functionality
   - Implement special cases and edge conditions

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Scenario-based tests for complex rule interactions
   - Performance tests for multiplayer scenarios

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation of implementation details
   - Cross-referencing with official rules
   - Examples of complex interactions

This structured approach ensures a robust implementation of the Commander format that accurately reflects the official rules while maintaining performance and extensibility.
