# Commander Rules Engine Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture for implementing a comprehensive Magic: The Gathering rules engine for the Commander format. The engine is designed to support games with 2-13 players while maintaining all the unique aspects of Commander gameplay.

## Architecture Overview

The Commander rules engine is organized into several interconnected modules:

1. **Game State Management** - Core state tracking and management
2. **Player Management** - Player data, life totals, and Commander-specific player mechanics
3. **Turn Structure & Phases** - Implementation of the complete turn sequence
4. **Command Zone** - Special zone management for Commander cards
5. **Combat System** - Multiplayer combat including attack declaration and damage
6. **Priority & Stack** - Priority passing and stack resolution
7. **State-Based Actions** - Game state checks and automatic actions
8. **Special Commander Rules** - Commander damage, color identity, and other format-specific rules
9. **Multiplayer Politics** - Voting, deal-making, and other multiplayer social mechanics

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The Commander rules engine will build upon the existing card implementation, leveraging:
- Card data structures and types
- Mana system
- Basic game loop framework

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Extensive use of Bevy ECS for game state management
- Event-driven architecture for game actions
- Comprehensive testing for complex rule interactions

Each module is described in detail in its respective document.

## Key Challenges

1. **Scale & Performance**: Supporting up to 13 players requires optimized systems
2. **Rule Complexity**: Commander has many unique rules and card interactions
3. **UI Considerations**: Managing the visual representation of a complex multiplayer state
4. **Networking**: Future multiplayer implementation over network connections

## Next Steps

1. Implement core game state management
2. Build Commander-specific zone handling
3. Develop multiplayer turn structure
4. Create comprehensive testing framework for rule validation
