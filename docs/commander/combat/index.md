The combat section defines how combat works in Commander games:

- Standard combat phases (beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, end of combat)
- Commander damage tracking (21+ combat damage from a single commander causes a loss)
- Multiplayer attack declaration (attacking different players in the same combat)
- Special handling for commander-specific combat abilities
- Handling combat triggers in multiplayer scenarios

Combat in Commander is particularly complex due to the multiplayer nature of the format and the special rule regarding commander damage, which adds an additional loss condition to the game.
