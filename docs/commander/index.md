## Overview

Commander (formerly known as Elder Dragon Highlander or EDH) is a multiplayer format for Magic: The Gathering with the following key characteristics:

- 100-card singleton format (only one copy of each card except for basic lands)
- Each player has a legendary creature designated as their "commander"
- Deck can only include cards that match the color identity of the commander
- Players start with 40 life
- Commanders begin in the Command Zone and can be cast for an increasing cost
- 21 combat damage from a single commander causes a player to lose

This documentation outlines our implementation of these rules and mechanics in the Rummage game engine.

## Testing Approach

Each section includes detailed test cases to validate the correct implementation of Commander rules. Our testing approach ensures:

1. Full coverage of Commander-specific rules
2. Edge case handling for unique interactions
3. Performance validation for multiplayer scenarios
4. Verification of correct rule application in complex board states

For implementation details, see the respective sections.
