# Card Visualization

This section covers the systems and components used to visualize cards in the game UI. Card visualization is a critical part of the user experience, as cards are the primary objects players interact with.

## Overview

The card visualization system is responsible for:

- Rendering cards with appropriate artwork, text, and stats
- Displaying different card states (tapped, flipped, face-down, etc.)
- Animating card movements and state changes
- Supporting responsive layout across different screen sizes

## Key Components

- [Card Rendering](card_rendering.md): How cards are visually represented
- [Card States](card_states.md): How different card states are visualized
- [Card Animations](card_animations.md): How cards animate between states and positions

## Implementation

Card visualization uses Bevy's rendering systems and components to create an efficient and visually appealing representation of Magic the Gathering cards.
