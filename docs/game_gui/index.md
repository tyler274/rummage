## Overview

The Game UI system is responsible for rendering the game state, facilitating player interactions, and providing visual feedback. Built using Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, the UI serves as the visual representation layer that connects the player to the underlying game mechanics.

Our UI design philosophy focuses on three key principles:

1. **Clarity**: Making game state clearly visible and understandable
2. **Usability**: Providing intuitive interactions for complex game mechanics
3. **Immersion**: Creating a visually appealing and thematically consistent experience

The UI system functions as a bridge between the player and the game engine, translating ECS component data into visual elements and user inputs into game actions. It maintains its own set of UI-specific entities and components that represent the visual state of the game, which are updated in response to changes in the core game state.

For a more detailed overview, see the [overview document](overview.md).

## Integration with Card Systems

The Game UI system works in close collaboration with the [Card Systems](../card_systems/index.md) to transform the core game data into interactive visual elements:

### Visualization Pipeline

The UI receives card data from the Card Systems and renders it according to the current game state:

- Card entities from the game engine are mapped to visual representations
- The UI listens for changes to card components (like tapped status or counters)
- Visual effects are applied based on card state changes

### Interaction Translation

User interactions with card visuals are translated back into game engine commands:

- Dragging a card triggers zone transfer requests in the game engine
- Clicking on cards selects them for targeting or activation
- Right-clicking shows context-sensitive actions relevant to the card

### Special Card Rendering

Some cards require special UI handling:

- Modal cards present choice interfaces
- Split cards have multiple faces to visualize
- Transformed cards need to show both states
- Cards with counters display them visually

For detailed information on how cards are represented in the data model, see the [Card Database](../card_systems/database/index.md) documentation.

## Integration with Networking

In multiplayer games, the UI system coordinates with the [Networking](../networking/index.md) module to ensure consistent visual representation across all clients:

### State Synchronization

The UI responds to network synchronization events:

- Updates card positions and states based on received snapshots
- Provides visual indicators for network operations (opponent thinking, sync status)
- Handles delayed or out-of-order updates gracefully

### Action Broadcasting

When a player performs an action, the UI:

1. Shows a local preview of the expected result
2. Sends the action to the server via the networking system
3. Updates the display when confirmation is received
4. Handles conflicts if server state differs from prediction

### Latency Compensation

To provide a responsive feel despite network latency:

- The UI implements client-side prediction for common actions
- Visual feedback indicates when actions are pending confirmation
- Animated transitions smooth out state updates from the server

For more detailed information on how the UI integrates with networked gameplay, see the [Gameplay Networking](../networking/gameplay/index.md) documentation.
