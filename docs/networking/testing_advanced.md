## Commander-Specific Testing

Commander as a format has unique rules and complex card interactions that require specialized testing.

### Multiplayer Politics Testing

Test how the networking handles multi-player political interactions:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_multiplayer_politics() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4); // 4 players
    
    // Simulate player 1 offering a deal to player 2
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::ProposeDeal {
            proposer: 1,
            target: 2,
            proposal: "I won't attack you this turn if you don't attack me next turn".to_string()
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(5); // Allow time for messages to propagate
    
    // Verify deal is visible to both players but hidden from others
    let client1 = get_client_view(&app, 1);
    let client2 = get_client_view(&app, 2);
    let client3 = get_client_view(&app, 3);
    let client4 = get_client_view(&app, 4);
    
    assert!(client1.can_see_proposal(proposal_id));
    assert!(client2.can_see_proposal(proposal_id));
    assert!(!client3.can_see_proposal(proposal_id));
    assert!(!client4.can_see_proposal(proposal_id));
    
    // Player 2 accepts deal
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::RespondToDeal {
            player: 2,
            proposal_id,
            response: ProposalResponse::Accept
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(5);
    
    // Verify deal acceptance is recorded and visible
    assert!(client1.proposals.contains_accepted(proposal_id));
    assert!(client2.proposals.contains_accepted(proposal_id));
}
```

### Commander Damage Testing

Verify correct tracking and synchronization of commander damage:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_commander_damage_tracking() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Setup commanders for all players
    for player_id in 1..=4 {
        app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
            .setup_commander(player_id, commander_card_ids[player_id-1]);
    }
    
    // Player 1's commander deals damage to player 2
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::AttackWithCommander {
            attacker: 1,
            defender: 2,
            damage: 5
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(10);
    
    // Verify commander damage is tracked and synchronized
    for player_id in 1..=4 {
        let client = get_client_view(&app, player_id);
        
        // All players should see same commander damage value
        assert_eq!(
            client.commander_damage_received[2][1], 
            5,
            "Player {} sees incorrect commander damage", 
            player_id
        );
    }
    
    // Second attack with commander
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::AttackWithCommander {
            attacker: 1,
            defender: 2,
            damage: 6
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(10);
    
    // Check for player death from 21+ commander damage
    for player_id in 1..=4 {
        let client = get_client_view(&app, player_id);
        
        // Commander damage should be cumulative
        assert_eq!(client.commander_damage_received[2][1], 11);
        
        // Player 2 is still alive (under 21 damage)
        assert!(client.players[2].is_alive);
    }
    
    // Final attack for lethal commander damage
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::AttackWithCommander {
            attacker: 1,
            defender: 2,
            damage: 10
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(10);
    
    // Verify player death and synchronization
    for player_id in 1..=4 {
        let client = get_client_view(&app, player_id);
        
        // Player 2 should be dead from commander damage
        assert_eq!(client.commander_damage_received[2][1], 21);
        assert!(!client.players[2].is_alive);
        assert_eq!(
            client.players[2].death_reason, 
            DeathReason::CommanderDamage(1)
        );
    }
}
```

## Long-Running Game Tests

MTG Commander games can be lengthy. We need to test stability and synchronization over extended play sessions.

```rust
#[test]
fn test_long_running_game() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Configure for extended test
    app.insert_resource(LongGameSimulation {
        turns_to_simulate: 20,
        actions_per_turn: 30,
        complexity_factor: 0.8, // Higher values = more complex actions
    });
    
    // Run the long game simulation
    app.add_systems(Update, long_game_simulation);
    
    // Run enough updates for the full simulation
    // (20 turns * 30 actions * 5 updates per action)
    app.update_n_times(20 * 30 * 5);
    
    // Assess results
    let metrics = app.world.resource::<GameMetrics>();
    
    // Check key reliability metrics
    assert!(metrics.desync_events == 0, "Game had state desynchronization events");
    assert!(metrics.error_count < 5, "Too many errors during extended play");
    assert!(metrics.network_bandwidth_average < MAX_BANDWIDTH_TARGET);
    
    // Verify final game state consistency
    verify_game_state_consistency(&app);
}
```

## Concurrency and Race Condition Testing

Test for race conditions and concurrency issues that might occur when multiple network events arrive simultaneously:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_simultaneous_actions() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Create a scenario where multiple clients try to act at the exact same time
    let test_controller = app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>();
    
    // Configure test to deliver these actions "simultaneously" to the server
    test_controller.queue_simultaneous_actions(vec![
        (1, TestAction::CastSpell { card_id: 101, targets: vec![201] }),
        (2, TestAction::ActivateAbility { card_id: 202, ability_id: 1 }),
        (3, TestAction::PlayLand { card_id: 303 }),
    ]);
    
    // Process the simultaneous actions
    app.update();
    
    // Verify the server handled them in a deterministic order
    // and all clients ended up with the same state
    let server_state = extract_server_game_state(&app);
    
    for client_id in 1..=4 {
        let client_state = extract_client_game_state(&app, client_id);
        
        assert_eq!(
            server_state.action_history,
            client_state.action_history,
            "Client {} has different action order from server", 
            client_id
        );
    }
}
```

## Snapshot and Replay Testing

Implement snapshot testing to capture and replay complex game states to ensure deterministic behavior:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_game_state_snapshot_restore() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Play several turns to reach a complex game state
    simulate_game_turns(&mut app, 5);
    
    // Take a snapshot of the current game state
    let snapshot = create_game_snapshot(&app);
    
    // Save snapshot to disk for future tests
    save_snapshot(&snapshot, "complex_board_state.snapshot");
    
    // Create a fresh app and restore the snapshot
    let mut restored_app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    restore_game_snapshot(&mut restored_app, &snapshot);
    
    // Verify restored state matches original
    let original_state = extract_game_state(&app);
    let restored_state = extract_game_state(&restored_app);
    
    assert_eq!(original_state, restored_state, "Restored state does not match original");
    
    // Execute identical actions on both instances
    let test_actions = generate_test_actions();
    
    for action in &test_actions {
        execute_action(&mut app, action);
        execute_action(&mut restored_app, action);
    }
    
    // Verify both instances end in identical states
    let final_original_state = extract_game_state(&app);
    let final_restored_state = extract_game_state(&restored_app);
    
    assert_eq!(
        final_original_state, 
        final_restored_state,
        "Divergent states after identical action sequences"
    );
}
```

## Fault Injection Testing

Systematically introduce faults to verify the system's resilience:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_client_disconnect_reconnect() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Play several turns
    simulate_game_turns(&mut app, 3);
    
    // Force disconnect client 2
    app.world.resource_mut::<NetworkController>()
        .disconnect_client(2);
    
    // Continue game for a turn
    simulate_game_turns(&mut app, 1);
    
    // Snapshot game state before reconnection
    let state_before_reconnect = extract_game_state(&app);
    
    // Reconnect client 2
    app.world.resource_mut::<NetworkController>()
        .reconnect_client(2);
    
    // Allow time for state synchronization
    app.update_n_times(20);
    
    // Verify reconnected client has correct state
    let client2_state = extract_client_game_state(&app, 2);
    let server_state = extract_server_game_state(&app);
    
    assert_eq!(
        server_state.public_state,
        client2_state.public_state,
        "Reconnected client failed to synchronize state"
    );
    
    // Continue play and verify client 2 can take actions
    app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>()
        .execute_action(TestAction::PlayCard {
            player_id: 2,
            card_id: 123
        });
    
    app.update_n_times(5);
    
    // Verify action was processed
    let updated_state = extract_game_state(&app);
    assert!(updated_state.contains_played_card(2, 123));
}
```

## Load and Stress Testing

Test how the system performs under high load:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_high_action_throughput() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Configure test with high action frequency
    app.insert_resource(ActionThroughputTest {
        actions_per_second: 50,
        test_duration_seconds: 30,
    });
    
    // Run stress test
    app.add_systems(Update, high_throughput_test);
    app.update_n_times(30 * 60); // 30 seconds at 60 fps
    
    // Collect performance metrics
    let metrics = app.world.resource::<PerformanceMetrics>();
    
    // Verify system maintained performance under load
    assert!(metrics.action_processing_success_rate > 0.95); // >95% successful
    assert!(metrics.average_frame_time < 16.67); // Maintain 60fps (16.67ms)
    assert!(metrics.network_bandwidth_max < MAX_BANDWIDTH_LIMIT);
    
    // Verify game state remained consistent despite high throughput
    verify_game_state_consistency(&app);
}
```

## Cross-Platform Testing

Test networking across different platforms and configurations:

```rust
// This would be implemented in CI pipeline to test different combinations
fn test_cross_platform() {
    // Test matrix for different platforms/configurations
    let platforms = ["Windows", "MacOS", "Linux"];
    let network_conditions = [
        NetworkCondition::Ideal,
        NetworkCondition::Home,
        NetworkCondition::Mobile,
    ];
    
    for server_platform in &platforms {
        for client_platform in &platforms {
            for &network_condition in &network_conditions {
                // Create test configuration
                let test_config = CrossPlatformTest {
                    server_platform: server_platform.to_string(),
                    client_platform: client_platform.to_string(),
                    network_condition,
                };
                
                // This would trigger tests on CI infrastructure
                run_cross_platform_test(test_config);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Automated Test Generation

Implement systems to automatically generate test scenarios:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_generated_scenarios() {
    let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(4);
    
    // Generate random but valid test scenarios
    let scenario_generator = TestScenarioGenerator::new()
        .with_seed(12345) // For reproducibility
        .with_complexity(TestComplexity::High)
        .with_game_progress(GameProgress::MidGame)
        .with_focus(TestFocus::ComplexBoardStates);
    
    // Generate 10 different test scenarios
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let scenario = scenario_generator.generate();
        
        // Set up the test scenario
        setup_test_scenario(&mut app, &scenario);
        
        // Run the test actions
        for action in scenario.actions {
            app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>().execute_action(action);
            app.update_n_times(5);
        }
        
        // Verify game state is consistent and valid
        verify_game_state_consistency(&app);
        verify_game_rules_not_violated(&app);
        
        // Reset for next scenario
        app.world.resource_mut::<TestController>().reset_game();
    }
}
```

## Property-Based Testing

Use property-based testing to verify game invariants hold under various conditions:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_game_invariants() {
    // Setup property testing
    proptest::proptest!(|(
        num_players in 2..=4usize,
        game_turns in 1..20usize,
        actions_per_turn in 1..30usize,
        network_latency_ms in 0..500u64,
        packet_loss_percent in 0.0..15.0f32,
    )| {
        // Create test app with the specified conditions
        let mut app = setup_multiplayer_test_app(num_players);
        
        // Configure network conditions
        app.insert_resource(NetworkSimulation {
            latency: Some(network_latency_ms),
            packet_loss: Some(packet_loss_percent / 100.0),
            jitter: Some(network_latency_ms / 5),
        });
        
        // Run simulation
        simulate_game_with_params(&mut app, game_turns, actions_per_turn);
        
        // Check invariants that should always hold true
        let game_state = extract_game_state(&app);
        
        // Invariant 1: All players have exactly 1 commander (if alive)
        for player_id in 1..=num_players {
            let player = &game_state.players[player_id-1];
            if player.is_alive {
                assert_eq!(player.commanders.len(), 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Invariant 2: Total cards in game remains constant
        assert_eq!(
            game_state.total_cards_in_game,
            STARTING_CARD_COUNT * num_players
        );
        
        // Invariant 3: No player has negative life
        for player in &game_state.players {
            assert!(player.life >= 0);
        }
        
        // Invariant 4: All clients have consistent public information
        verify_public_state_consistency(&app);
    });
}
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

Implement analysis tools to track test coverage specifically for networking and multiplayer aspects:

```rust
#[test]
fn generate_test_coverage_report() {
    // Run all networking tests with coverage tracking
    let results = run_tests_with_coverage("networking::");
    
    // Analyze coverage results
    let coverage = NetworkingCoverageAnalysis::from_results(&results);
    
    // Generate coverage report
    let report = coverage.generate_report();
    
    // Output report to file
    std::fs::write("networking_coverage.html", report).unwrap();
    
    // Verify minimum coverage thresholds
    assert!(coverage.message_types_covered > 0.95); // >95% of message types tested
    assert!(coverage.error_handlers_covered > 0.9); // >90% of error handlers tested
    assert!(coverage.synchronization_paths_covered > 0.9); // >90% of sync paths tested
    
    // Print coverage summary
    println!("Network message coverage: {:.1}%", coverage.message_types_covered * 100.0);
    println!("Error handler coverage: {:.1}%", coverage.error_handlers_covered * 100.0);
    println!("Sync path coverage: {:.1}%", coverage.synchronization_paths_covered * 100.0);
}
```
