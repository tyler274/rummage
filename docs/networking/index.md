## Overview

The networking system enables multiplayer gameplay with features like state synchronization, lobby management, and rollback mechanisms for handling network disruptions. The implementation is built on bevy_replicon, providing a robust foundation for networked gameplay.

For a comprehensive overview, see the [Core Architecture Overview](core/architecture_overview.md).

## Recent Updates

Recent updates to the networking documentation include:

- **Replicon Integration**: Added detailed documentation for integrating bevy_replicon with our RNG state management system
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Enhanced documentation of rollback mechanisms for handling network disruptions
- **Test Framework**: Expanded testing documentation with new test cases for RNG synchronization
- **Performance Considerations**: Added guidance on optimizing network performance

## Getting Started

To begin working on the networking implementation:

1. Review the [Core Architecture Overview](core/architecture_overview.md)
2. Understand the [Implementation Details](core/implementation_details.md)
3. Set up a local development environment with bevy_replicon
4. Start with the basic client-server connectivity
5. Incrementally add features following the implementation plan

## Future Enhancements

In future versions, we plan to enhance the networking implementation with:

- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-players to watch games in progress
- **Replay System**: Record and replay games for analysis or sharing
- **Tournament Support**: Special features for organizing and running tournaments
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Ensure compatibility across different platforms
- **Advanced Anti-Cheat**: More sophisticated measures to prevent cheating
- **Voice Chat Integration**: In-game communication between players
