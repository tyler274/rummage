# Networking Documentation

Welcome to the networking documentation for the MTG Commander game engine. This section outlines the planned implementation for multiplayer functionality using bevy_replicon.

## Table of Contents

1. **[Overview](overview.md)** - Introduction to networking architecture and concepts
2. **[Implementation Details](implementation.md)** - Detailed implementation guidelines and code structure
3. **[Protocol Specification](protocol.md)** - Networking protocol, message formats, and synchronization
4. **[Testing Strategy](testing.md)** - Approach to testing the networking implementation
5. **[Future Enhancements](#future-enhancements)** - Planned improvements and advanced features

## Key Networking Features

Our networking implementation provides:

- **Robust Client-Server Architecture**: Authoritative server with client prediction
- **Secure MTG Gameplay**: Properly handling hidden information (hands, libraries)
- **Commander Format Support**: Special handling for command zone, commander damage, etc.
- **Efficient State Synchronization**: Only sending necessary updates to minimize bandwidth
- **Resilient Connection Handling**: Automatic reconnection and state recovery
- **Anti-Cheat Measures**: Preventing common cheating methods in card games

## Integration with Game Engine

The networking layer integrates with the core game engine by:

1. Converting game actions to network messages
2. Validating all actions on the server
3. Synchronizing game state across clients
4. Handling MTG-specific concepts like priority, stack, and phases

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Features | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1     | Basic client-server connectivity, lobby system | Planned |
| 2     | Game state replication, player actions | Planned |
| 3     | Card visibility, zone handling | Planned |
| 4     | Advanced gameplay features (stack, targeting) | Planned |
| 5     | Performance optimization, stress testing | Planned |

## Future Enhancements

In future versions, we plan to enhance the networking implementation with:

- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-players to watch games in progress
- **Replay System**: Record and replay games for analysis or sharing
- **Tournament Support**: Special features for organizing and running tournaments
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Ensure compatibility across different platforms
- **Advanced Anti-Cheat**: More sophisticated measures to prevent cheating
- **Voice Chat Integration**: In-game communication between players

## Getting Started with Development

To begin working on the networking implementation:

1. Review the [overview](overview.md) and [implementation](implementation.md) documents
2. Set up a local development environment with bevy_replicon
3. Start with the basic client-server connectivity
4. Incrementally add features following the implementation plan

For detailed instructions on setting up the development environment, see the [implementation document](implementation.md).
