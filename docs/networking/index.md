# Networking Documentation

Welcome to the restructured networking documentation for the MTG Commander game engine. This section outlines the implementation for multiplayer functionality using bevy_replicon.

## Organization

The networking documentation is organized into the following major sections:

1. **[Core Networking](core/)** - Foundational networking concepts and architecture
2. **[Lobby System](lobby/)** - Documentation for the multiplayer lobby system
3. **[Gameplay Networking](gameplay/)** - In-game networking features and behaviors
4. **[Testing](testing/)** - Testing strategies and methodologies
5. **[Security](security/)** - Security considerations and implementation

## Core Networking

- [Architecture Overview](core/architecture_overview.md) - Introduction to networking architecture and concepts
- [Implementation Details](core/implementation_details.md) - Detailed implementation guidelines and code structure
- [Protocol Specification](core/protocol_specification.md) - Networking protocol, message formats, and synchronization
- [Multiplayer Overview](core/multiplayer_overview.md) - High-level overview of multiplayer functionality
- [RNG Synchronization](core/implementation_details.md#random-number-generator-synchronization) - Managing random number generation across network boundaries

## Lobby System

The Lobby System documentation is further organized into:

- [Lobby Index](lobby/index.md) - Overview of the lobby system
- [UI Components](lobby/ui/) - Documentation for user interface components
  - [Overview](lobby/ui/overview.md) - General overview of the lobby UI
  - [Detail View](lobby/ui/detail_view.md) - Detailed lobby UI implementation
- [Backend](lobby/backend/) - Server-side implementation details
  - [Implementation](lobby/backend/implementation.md) - Backend implementation
  - [Networking](lobby/backend/networking.md) - Backend networking details
- [Chat System](lobby/chat/) - Chat functionality documentation
  - [UI](lobby/chat/ui.md) - Chat UI implementation
- [Deck Viewer](lobby/deck/) - Deck viewing and management
  - [Viewer](lobby/deck/viewer.md) - Deck viewer implementation

## Gameplay Networking

- [Departure Handling](gameplay/departure/handling.md) - Handling player disconnections and departures
- [State Management](gameplay/state/) - Game state synchronization
- [Synchronization](gameplay/synchronization/) - Methods for keeping game state in sync

## Testing

- [Testing Overview](testing/overview.md) - General testing approach
- [Advanced Techniques](testing/advanced_techniques.md) - Advanced testing techniques
- [RNG Synchronization Tests](testing/rng_synchronization_tests.md) - Testing RNG determinism in multiplayer
- [Integration Testing](testing/integration/) - Integration testing methodologies
  - [Strategy](testing/integration/strategy.md) - Integration testing strategy
- [Security Testing](testing/security/) - Security-focused testing
  - [Strategy](testing/security/strategy.md) - Security testing strategy

## Security

- [Authentication](security/authentication.md) - User authentication and authorization
- [Anti-Cheat](security/anti_cheat.md) - Preventing and detecting cheating
- [Hidden Information](security/hidden_information.md) - Managing hidden game information

## Getting Started with Development

To begin working on the networking implementation:

1. Review the [Core Architecture Overview](core/architecture_overview.md)
2. Understand the [Implementation Details](core/implementation_details.md)
3. Set up a local development environment with bevy_replicon
4. Start with the basic client-server connectivity
5. Incrementally add features following the implementation plan

## Future Enhancements

In future versions, we plan to enhance the networking implementation with:

- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-players to watch games in progress
- **Replay System**: Record and replay games for analysis or sharing
- **Tournament Support**: Special features for organizing and running tournaments
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Ensure compatibility across different platforms
- **Advanced Anti-Cheat**: More sophisticated measures to prevent cheating
- **Voice Chat Integration**: In-game communication between players
