# Networking Integration Testing

This section covers the integration testing approach for the networking components of the MTG Commander game engine.

## Overview

Integration testing for networking components ensures that different parts of the networking stack work together correctly, from low-level protocols to high-level gameplay synchronization.

## Components

### [Strategy](strategy.md)

Detailed strategy for integration testing of networking components, including:
- Test environment setup
- Integration test suite organization
- Mocking and simulation approaches
- Continuous integration workflow
- Regression testing methodology
- Performance benchmarking

## Testing Scope

The integration testing covers:
- Client-server communication
- Peer-to-peer interactions
- Protocol compatibility
- State synchronization across clients
- Error handling and recovery
- Network condition simulation
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Integration with Other Testing

This testing approach integrates with:
- [Unit Testing](../../../testing/unit_testing.md) for individual component validation
- [End-to-End Testing](../../../testing/end_to_end_testing.md) for full system validation
- [Performance Testing](../../../testing/performance_testing.md) for network performance evaluation
- [Security Testing](../security/index.md) for network security validation
