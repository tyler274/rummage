# Game State Synchronization

This section covers the synchronization mechanisms used to ensure consistent game state across all clients in a networked Magic: The Gathering Commander game.

## Overview

State synchronization is critical for maintaining a fair and consistent gameplay experience. Our implementation focuses on:

- Deterministic gameplay logic
- Efficient state updates
- Handling of random elements
- Resolution of inconsistencies
- Hidden information management

## Components

### [RNG Rollback](rng_rollback.md)

Implementation details for synchronizing random number generation across clients, including:
- Deterministic RNG sequence generation
- Seed management
- Rollback capabilities for RNG state
- Verification mechanisms for RNG consistency

## Integration

This system integrates closely with:
- [State Management](../state/index.md) for overall game state
- [Rollback System](../state/rollback.md) for handling state corrections
- [Action Broadcasting](../action_broadcasting.md) for communicating state changes
- [Latency Compensation](../latency_compensation.md) for responsive gameplay despite network delays

## Testing

Comprehensive testing of synchronization mechanisms is covered in the [Testing section](../../testing/index.md), with specific focus on:
- [RNG Synchronization Tests](../../testing/rng_synchronization_tests.md)
- [Replicon RNG Tests](../../testing/replicon_rng_tests.md)
