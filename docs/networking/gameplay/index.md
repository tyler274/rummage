# Gameplay Networking Documentation

This section covers the networking aspects specific to gameplay in the MTG Commander game engine. While the lobby system handles pre-game setup, the gameplay networking components manage the actual game session, including state synchronization, player actions, and handling departures.

## Overview

The gameplay networking implementation focuses on several key areas:

1. **State Management**: Maintaining and synchronizing the game state across all clients
2. **Action Processing**: Handling player actions and their effects on the game state
3. **Synchronization**: Ensuring all clients have a consistent view of the game
4. **Departure Handling**: Managing player disconnections and reconnections

## Gameplay Components

### State Management

The [State Management](state/index.md) system handles the representation and replication of game state:

- Core game state structure and components
- State replication with bevy_replicon
- Hidden information management
- State consistency and verification

### Synchronization

The [Synchronization](synchronization/index.md) system ensures all clients maintain a consistent view of the game:

- Server-authoritative model
- Command-based synchronization
- Incremental state updates
- Tick-based processing
- Handling network issues

### Departure Handling

The [Departure Handling](departure/handling.md) system manages player disconnections and reconnections:

- Detecting disconnections
- Preserving game state for disconnected players
- Handling reconnections
- Game continuation policies
- Timeout and abandonment handling

## Implementation Principles

Our gameplay networking implementation follows these core principles:

1. **Server Authority**: The server is the single source of truth for game state
2. **Minimal Network Usage**: Only necessary information is transmitted
3. **Resilience**: The system can handle network disruptions gracefully
4. **Security**: Hidden information remains protected
5. **Fairness**: All players have equal opportunity regardless of network conditions

## Integration with Other Systems

The gameplay networking components integrate with several other systems:

- **Lobby System**: For transitioning from lobby to game
- **Security**: For protecting hidden information and preventing cheating
- **Testing**: For validating network behavior and performance

## Future Enhancements

Planned gameplay networking enhancements include:

- **Spectator Mode**: Allow non-players to watch games in progress
- **Replay System**: Record and replay games for analysis
- **Enhanced Reconnection**: More sophisticated state recovery for long disconnections
- **Optimized Synchronization**: Improved performance for complex game states
- **Cross-Platform Play**: Ensure consistent experience across different platforms
