# Player Departure Handling

This section covers the handling of player departures in networked gameplay, focusing on maintaining game integrity when players disconnect or leave a game in progress.

## Overview

In multiplayer games, especially Commander format, player departures can significantly impact gameplay. This system handles:

- Graceful disconnections (player intentionally leaves)
- Unexpected disconnections (network failures, crashes)
- Temporary disconnections with reconnection potential
- Permanent departures that require game state adjustments

## Components

### [Departure Handling](handling.md)

Detailed implementation of how player departures are processed, including:
- State preservation for potential reconnection
- Game state adjustments when a player permanently leaves
- Handling of in-progress actions when a player disconnects
- Object ownership transfer upon player departure
- AI takeover options for departed players

## Integration

This system integrates closely with:
- [State Management](../state/index.md) for game state consistency
- [Rollback System](../state/rollback.md) for handling in-progress actions
- [Synchronization](../synchronization/index.md) for maintaining consistency across clients
