# Anti-Cheat Measures in MTG Commander Game Engine

This document outlines the anti-cheat mechanisms implemented in the MTG Commander game engine to ensure fair gameplay in multiplayer sessions.

## Overview

Preventing cheating is essential for maintaining a fair and enjoyable multiplayer experience. The MTG Commander game engine implements several layers of anti-cheat measures to detect and prevent various forms of cheating.

## Types of Cheating Addressed

1. **Client Modification**: Tampering with the game client to gain advantages
2. **Memory Manipulation**: Directly modifying game memory to alter game state
3. **Network Manipulation**: Intercepting and modifying network traffic
4. **Information Exposure**: Accessing hidden information (opponent's hands, library order)
5. **Automation/Botting**: Using automated tools to play the game

## Implementation Approach

### Server Authority Model

The game uses a server-authoritative model where critical game state and rules enforcement happens on the server:

```rust
// Server-side validation of player actions
fn validate_play_card_action(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut server: ResMut<RepliconServer>,
    mut play_events: EventReader<PlayCardEvent>,
    game_states: Query<&GameState>,
    players: Query<(Entity, &Player, &Hand)>,
) {
    for event in play_events.read() {
        let client_id = event.client_id;
        let card_id = event.card_id;
        
        // Find the player entity for this client
        if let Some((player_entity, player, hand)) = players
            .iter()
            .find(|(_, player, _)| player.client_id == client_id) 
        {
            // Verify the player actually has this card in hand
            if !hand.cards.contains(&card_id) {
                // Log potential cheating attempt
                warn!("Potential cheat detected: Client {} attempted to play card {} not in hand", client_id, card_id);
                
                // Send cheat detection notification
                server.send_message(client_id, CheatWarning { 
                    reason: "Attempted to play card not in hand".to_string() 
                });
                
                // Skip processing this invalid action
                continue;
            }
            
            // Continue with normal processing if validation passes
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Client-Side Integrity Checks

The client includes integrity verification to detect tampering:

```rust
// Client-side integrity check system
fn verify_client_integrity(
    mut integrity_state: ResMut<IntegrityState>,
    mut client: ResMut<RepliconClient>,
) {
    // Perform integrity checks
    let checksum = calculate_code_checksum();
    
    // If checksum doesn't match expected value
    if checksum != integrity_state.expected_checksum {
        // Report integrity failure to server
        client.send_message(IntegrityFailure {
            reason: "Client code integrity check failed".to_string(),
            details: format!("Expected: {}, Got: {}", 
                integrity_state.expected_checksum, checksum),
        });
        
        // Set integrity failure state
        integrity_state.integrity_failed = true;
    }
}
```

### Network Traffic Validation

All network traffic is validated for consistency and authenticity:

```rust
// Server-side network traffic validation
fn validate_network_messages(
    mut server: ResMut<RepliconServer>,
    mut message_events: EventReader<NetworkMessageEvent>,
    client_states: Query<&ClientState>,
) {
    for event in message_events.read() {
        // Verify message sequence is correct (no missing messages)
        if let Ok(client_state) = client_states.get(event.client_entity) {
            if event.sequence_number != client_state.next_expected_sequence {
                // Potential replay or injection attack
                warn!("Sequence mismatch for client {}: Expected {}, got {}", 
                    event.client_id, client_state.next_expected_sequence, event.sequence_number);
                
                // Take appropriate action (request resync, disconnect, etc.)
                // ...
            }
        }
        
        // Verify message signature if using signed messages
        if !verify_message_signature(&event.message, &event.signature) {
            // Message tampering detected
            warn!("Invalid message signature from client {}", event.client_id);
            
            // Take appropriate action
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Detection and Response

### Anomaly Detection

The system monitors for statistical anomalies and suspicious patterns:

- Unusual timing between actions
- Statistically improbable sequences of draws or plays
- Impossible knowledge of hidden information

### Response to Detected Cheating

When potential cheating is detected, the system can respond in several ways:

1. **Warning**: For minor or first offenses
2. **Game Termination**: Ending the current game
3. **Temporary Ban**: Restricting access for a period
4. **Permanent Ban**: Blocking the user entirely
5. **Silent Monitoring**: Continuing to monitor without immediate action

## Testing Anti-Cheat Measures

Testing the anti-cheat system involves:

1. **Simulated Attacks**: Attempting various cheating methods in a controlled environment
2. **Penetration Testing**: Having security experts attempt to bypass protections
3. **False Positive Analysis**: Ensuring legitimate players aren't falsely flagged

For detailed testing procedures, see the [Security Testing Strategy](../testing/security/strategy.md).

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the anti-cheat system include:

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Enhanced client-side protection against memory editing
- Improved server-side validation of complex game states
- Community reporting and review system
