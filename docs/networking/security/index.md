# Security Documentation

This section covers all security-related aspects of the MTG Commander game engine networking implementation.

## Overview

The security measures for the game engine focus on:

1. **Anti-Cheat Mechanisms** - Preventing common cheating methods in online card games
2. **Secure Communication** - Ensuring secure data transmission between clients and server
3. **Hidden Information** - Protecting private game information (hands, libraries)
4. **Authentication** - Verifying player identities 
5. **Authorization** - Managing permissions for different actions

## Security Areas

- **[Anti-Cheat Implementation](anti_cheat.md)** - Implementation details for preventing cheating
- **[Hidden Information Management](hidden_information.md)** - Approaches to handling private game data
- **[Authentication System](authentication.md)** - Player identity verification
- **[Security Testing](../testing/security/strategy.md)** - Testing methodologies for security features

## Threat Modeling

This system considers the following primary threats:

1. **Card Information Disclosure** - Players gaining unauthorized access to hidden cards
2. **Game State Manipulation** - Players attempting to modify game state illegitimately
3. **Denial of Service** - Malicious disruption of game services
4. **Replay Attacks** - Reusing legitimate actions in unintended contexts

## Implementation Approach

The security implementation follows these principles:

- **Server Authority** - The server is the authority on all game state
- **Least Privilege** - Clients only receive information they should have access to
- **Defense in Depth** - Multiple security layers protect critical functionality
- **Regular Validation** - Continuous checking of game state consistency

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

- Advanced encryption for all network communication
- Improved anti-tampering measures
- Enhanced logging and auditing capabilities
- Expanded security testing automation
