# Security Documentation for MTG Commander Networking

This section covers the security aspects of the MTG Commander game engine's networking implementation. Security is a critical consideration for any multiplayer game, especially one that involves hidden information and competitive gameplay.

## Overview

The security implementation for the MTG Commander game engine focuses on several key areas:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensuring only legitimate users can access the game
2. **Hidden Information Management**: Protecting game-critical hidden information
3. **Anti-Cheat Measures**: Preventing and detecting cheating attempts
4. **Network Security**: Securing communication between clients and servers
5. **Data Protection**: Safeguarding user data and game state

## Security Components

### Authentication

The [Authentication](authentication.md) system ensures that only legitimate users can connect to and participate in games. It covers:

- User identity verification
- Session management
- Credential security
- Protection against common authentication attacks

### Anti-Cheat

The [Anti-Cheat](anti_cheat.md) system prevents players from gaining unfair advantages through technical means. It addresses:

- Client modification detection
- Memory manipulation prevention
- Network traffic validation
- Anomaly detection and response
- Enforcement of game rules

### Hidden Information Management

The [Hidden Information](hidden_information.md) system protects game-critical information that should be hidden from some or all players. It covers:

- Player hand protection
- Library content and order security
- Face-down card management
- Selective information revelation
- Server-side information control

## Security Testing

Security testing is a critical aspect of ensuring the robustness of our security measures. For details on how we test security features, see the [Security Testing Strategy](../testing/security/strategy.md).

## Implementation Principles

Our security implementation follows these core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security to protect against different types of threats
2. **Least Privilege**: Components only have access to the information and capabilities they need
3. **Server Authority**: The server is the single source of truth for game state
4. **Secure by Default**: Security is built into the system from the ground up
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Security measures are regularly reviewed and enhanced

## Future Enhancements

Planned security enhancements include:

- Enhanced encryption for sensitive game actions
- Two-factor authentication support
- Advanced anti-cheat measures using machine learning
- Improved security testing automation
- Expanded security documentation and best practices

This documentation will be updated as security measures evolve.
