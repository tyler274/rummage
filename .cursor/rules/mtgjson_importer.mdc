The MTGJSON API importer for cards should include a build macro that actually imports and
generates card definition rust module files for every card from every set into the src/cards/sets directory.


The build macro should update the sets and card definitions if there are are any changes
or new card/sets. The build macro should also use the cache we implemented to respect API rate limits.
