please continue refactoring the cards module to be more in line with the docs in docs/
updating either as needed to improve the robustness of the implementation with unit tests.
Make sure the docs and the code stay synced. Focus on fixing all the warnings and then the
failing tests. 
Its ok to remove unused code that has no place in the final implementation, and there should not be much dead code
