1. Using Bevy 0.15.x APIs that aren't deprecated [deprecated_apis.md](mdc:docs/development/bevy_guide/deprecated_apis.md), we are implementing a robust unit and integrated end to end tested Magic the Gathering Commander format game engine.
2. Text2dBundle, SpriteBundle, NodeBundle, Camera2dBundle, SpatialBundle etc are deprecated for Text2d, Sprite, Node, and Camera2d respectively.
3. Use bevy_persistent for all persistent data operations.
4. Use bevy_replicon for networking. 
5. Always check for and fix any compiler warnings and errors when changing code.
6. Always keep documentation in sync with the implementation. 
7. Stage all the changed files determined using "git status" with a descriptive commit
message using repeated "-m" flags for proper multiline commits in a single command
invocation. 
8. Use chainable builder pattern APIs to construct structs in a reusable way. Especially
in test code. These builders/constructors should be const where possible.
