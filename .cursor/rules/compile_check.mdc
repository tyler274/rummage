# Compile Check Rule

Before staging files and committing changes, ensure the codebase compiles without any errors or warnings.

1. After making code modifications, run the appropriate build or check command for the project (e.g., `cargo check --all-targets --all-features` for Rust projects).
2. Address any reported compiler errors or warnings.
3. Only proceed with staging and committing once the compilation is clean.
