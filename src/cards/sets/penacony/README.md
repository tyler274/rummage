A card set based on Penacony from Honkai: Star Rail. Credit to /u/TearsOfTomorrowYT: 



Greetings, I am a day one HSR player and a long time Magic: The Gathering collector. So because I'm a completely normal person, I figured I would unite my two passions by creating over 250 custom MTG cards based on Penacony, and designing a fully functional, draft-ready set with them.

**The basics of the project**

This project saw the light at the beginning of summer 2024: alongside a few people from [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/vA8fFcsvCp), I decided to represent a few Penacony-based limited 5\* characters from HSR in MTG card form. This soon spiralled into wanting to create a full set, in which characters and events from the Penacony saga would be represented. While originally the idea was to simply have a bunch of important characters as creatures and a bunch of key events as instant/sorcery cards, the difficulties of making an actual set that people could play with became apparent, and a plethora of compromises and concessions had to be made. Notably, I soon ran out of NPCs I could use to create Uncommon and Common creatures, so eventually a bunch of characters, events and concepts from outside Penacony were included in order to fill the gaps. That said, the focus is still, first and foremost, on Penacony.

**Card-making guidelines and rules of the draft**

This is a Commander-centric set, to be drafted under Commander draft rules. It is thematically designed around the concept of "[allied color pairs](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Allied_color)", with each pair being represented by a designated commander. What this means is, for each color pair there is a bicolor mythic rare legendary creature who is specifically meant to act as a commander for that pair: when drafting, these designated commanders will not be among the cards the players can obtain from the draft. Instead, players will be encouraged to build a bicolor deck based on the cards they draft, and then they'll be able to simply hand-pick the designated commander who best suits the cards they got (two players can have the same designated commander, if they both are ok with it).

Originally the idea was that these designated commanders would be 5\* limited characters who were released during the Penacony arc: however, for the sake of guarantee thematic coherence and to guarantee each possible color pair would be represented, Duke Inferno (for Green/Red) and Sunday (for White/Blue) were also included. A second set depicting the rest of the Penacony story, designed around the concept of "[enemy color pair](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Enemy_color)", is already in the works, so if a character you like is not among the cards I am showcasing for this project, it's safe to assume they are scheduled to be in the second set.

Outside of the designated commanders, there are a few additional legendary creatures that represent other notable characters: in general, the rule is that only characters with unique 3D models (I.E. playable characters and unique NPCs such as Siobhan) get to be legendary cards. No matter how cool a NPC is or how important you feel they are to the plot, if they don't have a unique 3D models they will be relegated to being generic creatures (for example, Skott and Chadwick were notable victims of this). In fact, even some unique characters (such as the followers of Duke Inferno) and even some playable characters (such as Bailu) were relegated to being generic creatures, either as a joke or to fill out the roster: the goal was to only ever put the focus on characters who play an important role in the story of Penacony, and even then, half of those were moved to the second set.

The Trailblazer is a unique case: instead of making a card to represent them, I figured it would be more fun, and more appropriate given their nature as the main character, to represent them across multiple cards, including a cycle of bicolor creatures each representing them during different moments of the story.

**Making the cards**

Creating all these cards was a LONG process. I started in early june, and it took me until october to finish. The entire process can be divided into three phases:

1) The hyper creative phase: this is when I had just come up with the idea, and my mind was ablaze with card concepts. The best and most creative cards, most notably all the designated commanders, were created during this phase.

2) The serious phase: this is when I got serious about wanting these cards to come together as a full-fledged set. Functional reprints, reprints that fit the flavor of the setting, and cards that prioritize mechanics over storytelling were made during this phase.

3) The depths of despair phase: this is when I was finally hit with the reality of just how many common cards I needed to make. Zero effort throwaway reprints, as well as blatantly underpowered cards, were made during this phase, and if you spot a card that has wonky wording and/or typos and/or snafus with the artwork or card frame, chances are it was made during this phase as well.

**A note on crediting artists**

In the vast majority of cards you will see below, I did not credit an artist, for a simple reason: there was no artist to be credited. The overwhelming majority of these cards were made by using screenshots as the artworks: screenshots from the actual game, screenshots from various trailers, screenshots from various menus and tools, you name it. Needless to say, all that stuff belongs to Mihoyo and I have no legal claim on it.

In the few cases where actual fanart was used for the artwork of a card, the artist was credited in the bottom left corner of the card itself.

**Showcasing the cards**

And now, we finally get to the moment you were waiting for: arranged in convenient Google Drive folders, below are all the cards I created for this project!
