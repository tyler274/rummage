Using Bevy 0.15.x APIs that aren't deprecated, we are implementing a robust end to end

Always check for and fix any compiler warnings and errors.
After a code change if there are no compiler warnings and errors.
Stage all the changed files determined using "git status" with a descriptive commit message. 
If a command such as "cargo check" or "cargo test" hangs without output for 10 seconds or more just rerun it,
there's a bug.
