Using Bevy 0.15.x APIs that aren't deprecated, we are implementing a robust end to end
tested Magic the Gathering Commander format game engine.
Text2dBundle, SpriteBundle, NodeBundle, etc are deprecated for Text2d, Sprite, and Node respectively.
Always check for and fix any compiler warnings and errors.
After a code change check if there are no compiler warnings and errors.
Stage all the changed files determined using "git status" with a descriptive commit message. 
If a command such as "cargo check" or "cargo test" hangs without output for 10 seconds or more just rerun it,
there's a bug.
